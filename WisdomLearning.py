This module implements the WisdomLearning class using TensorFlow for integrating visual and clinical features.
It includes:
- Visual feature extraction using CNNs and Conv2D layers.
- Clinical feature extraction using LSTM layers.
- Integration of features through various encoding and embedding techniques.
- Wisdom learning techniques such as Region Pyramid Pooling (RPP) and QuadTree operations.
- Further processing with self-attention mechanisms and softmax activation.

Usage:
    # Example usage of the WisdomLearning class
    wisdom_model = WisdomLearning()
    outputs = wisdom_model(inputs)
    print(outputs)

Notes:
    This is a prototype implementation and is subject to further updates and improvements based on final outcomes.
